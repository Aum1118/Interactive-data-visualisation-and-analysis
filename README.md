Abstractâ€”Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) are fundamen-
tal to the healthcare infras tructure in India, particularly in
rural and underserved regions. Despite their importance, PHCs
face numerous challenges, including infrastructure deficiencies,
staffing shortages, and lack of essential medical equipment. This
study investigates the infrastructure and resource availability in
Primary Health Centres (PHCs) across different states and Union
Territories (UTs) of India. This research paper presents a detailed
analysis of these challenges using an interactive data analysis
approach. A Python-based dashboard app was developed to
visualize data through various plots such as tree maps, heatmaps,
pie charts, and bar charts, offering insights into the state-wise dis-
tribution of healthcare resources and their adequacy. The study
identifies major problems, subproblems, and proposes solutions
to en hance the efficiency and effectiveness of PHCs in India.
By analyzing the correlation between various infrastructural
and staffing variables and employing clustering techniques, we
identify patterns and critical shortages. This research aims to
provide insights for policymakers to optimize resource allocation
and address deficiencies in healthcare infrastructure.
